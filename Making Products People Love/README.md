# Making Products People Love

### Introduction (20 mins)

How many of us have used a product (especially a web or mobile app), and then fall in love with it (or at least liked it)?
* From a user’s point of view, what are the things you came across while using the product that made you fall in love with it?
* *Ensure they are not just listing features of products people use, but of products people love. So, you may ask: Are you saying if a product has these features you will love (or at least like) it? (Hint: look for points like “It meets my need”)*
* Make your own contribution:
    * At the beginning of 2017 I wanted to be able to ask: how much did I spend on transportation between March and July?
    * So I went to Play Store, and found about 4 personal finance apps that met my need. But at this point I couldn’t say I loved them.
    * So we can say: The product should satisfy a need. If it doesn’t, people won’t use it. If they don’t use it, they can’t love it.
    * I installed them, but quickly uninstalled all but 2 because I just couldn’t stand their UI.
    * So we can say: Good UI (user interface) (note that different people may have different ideas of what makes a good UI)
    * I then noticed that they provided option for me to store my financial records online so that I could access them across devices.
    * So we can say: The product should exceed expectation.
    * Eventually I uninstalled one because I noticed that it took me 3/4 steps to do what took 2/3 steps on the other one.
    * So we can say: Good UX (user experience) (change “Good UI” to “Good UI/UX”)
    * I like a product that is considerate of my resources:
        * It shouldn’t cost me too much money
        * It shouldn’t take me too long to get a hang of it
        * It shouldn’t consume too much bandwidth
        * It shouldn’t occupy too much space on my storage device
    * Emotional Design: How does the product make users feel?
        * This is why people will always prefer games, social networking apps, gossip apps to health, finance management apps, news apps (even though you can argue that the latter is more useful)
        * If you can create designs that encourage emotional responses you are on your way to creating a product people will love
