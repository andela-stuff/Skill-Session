# Making Recommendations

### Introduction (10 mins)
What do we understand by Making Recommendations?

### Real Life Example

### Why Do We Give Recommendations? (10 mins)
* Recommendations show us possible paths to follow in order to effect changes. Recommendations suggest solutions
* Recommendations define and prioritize the actions that need to be taken

### What is the Difference Between Recommendation and Feedback? (5 mins)
* I think recommendation is a kind of feedback that, in addition to pointing our existing problems, gives possible solutions. Recommendation does not just state observed anomaly, it identifies the root cause of such anomaly.
	* Remember "Problem Solving Processes": One of the important steps is root cause analysis...
* Recommendation is also goal-oriented: giving feedback that defines how specific goals can be reached.

### The Double-SMART Recommendation Model (15 mins)
You can read more about it [here](https://www.apt.ch/content/files_res/Briefing1_en.pdf)

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Result-Oriented
* Time-Bound
----
* Solution-Suggestive
* Mindful of Prioritisation, Sequencing & Risks
* Argued
* Root-Cause Responsive
* Targeted

We are used to the first SMART, let's talk about the second SMART.

### What Makes You Qualified to Give Recommendations?
* Preparation
* Being a stakeholder

### Recommended Roleplay (10 mins)
Recall that when we did "Building world class products/features" we were to suggest features for Cards for Humanity...  
Now let's put it in form of a formal recommendation:
* Prepare a concise report in doc or spreadsheets targeting the Program Owner, stating your recommendations for CFH.
* Remember the Double-SMART recommendation model
* Tell us who you are targeting

### Learning Outcomes (5 mins)
* Decision Making
* Seeks & Requests Feedbacks
* Writing Professionally
* Spreadsheets, Doc

-----
### Feedback
* People should be seated early.
* Contributions should not be "absolute": leave space for alternate views.
* Contributions should be better guided and controlled so discussions don't get out of hand and away from the topic.
* Points presented in the simulation manual are not to be used as instructions but as a scaffold to guide the skill session.
* Fellows should be made to understand that the skills discussed during the skill sessions are to be practised in real life.
