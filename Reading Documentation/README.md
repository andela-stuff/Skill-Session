# Reading Documentation

*this should hold in a room where the fellows can air play their screens*

### Introduction

If you are going to implement a feature and there are resources that you need to leverage, how would you go about understanding and making use of these resources?

### How Do You Use Documentation?

* Identify what exists in terms of resources and their documentation
* Look for the getting started part
    * prerequisite
    * overview
    * sample code
* Use documentation like a reference material, not a novel to be read cover to cover.
    * Recognise that documentation is often the most reliable source of info
* Have a clear purpose for reading documentation
    * Explicitly define what you want to know from the content
* Practice “Active Reading” techniques such as highlighting, underlining key info, taking notes.etc. so that you can review important points later

### Handling Bad Documentation

*like that of Sequelize?*

* Seek clarification from other users of the documentation
* Visit forums/communities
* Search for alternative materials
* Consider looking at the source code
