# Problem-Solving Processes

### Definition (10 mins)

* Basically these are the steps involved in going from a problem to a solution, right?
* *Pick someone to buttress on that*
* How does it differ from debugging?

### Steps Involved in Problem-Solving (15 mins)

* From your personal experiences solving problems, what are the typical steps you follow?
* Now let’s take 2 minutes and read up on problem-solving online, and then augment our list of steps
* Some steps to expect are:
    * Define the Problem (which includes identifying the root cause of the problem) Here you ask them if they can identify any problem with the following system:
        * Amity (focus on allocation)
        * Traffic in the city (focus on traffic light?)
        * Corruption in the government (focus on voting)
    * Generate alternative solutions
    * Evaluate and select a solution (what are some of the things you consider when picking a solution? Business constraints, available skills,…)
    * Implement and follow up on the solution
