# Problem-Solving Processes

### Definition (10 mins)

* Basically these are the steps involved in going from a problem to a solution, right?
* *Pick someone to buttress on that*
* <del>How does it differ from debugging?</del>

### Steps Involved in Problem-Solving (15 mins)

* From your personal experiences solving problems, what are the typical steps you follow?
* Now let’s take 2 minutes and read up on problem-solving online, and then augment our list of steps
* Some steps to expect are:
    * Define the Problem (which includes identifying the root cause of the problem) Here you ask them if they can identify any problem with the following system:
        * Queue at the cafeteria
        * Epic Tower car park problem
        * Waste Management
        * Amity (focus on allocation)
        * Traffic in the city (focus on traffic light?)
        * Corruption in the government (focus on voting)
    * Generate alternative solutions
    * Evaluate and select a solution (what are some of the things you consider when picking a solution? Business constraints, available skills,…)
    * Implement and follow up on the solution

### Learning Outcomes (10 mins)

*Share the LO for the day, and ask fellows to read up on them, explain them, and describe how they apply to today’s topic.*

* Problem-solving & critical thinking
* Data structures
* Algorithms
* Discrete Maths

### Roleplay (25 mins)

We are going to divide ourselves into 3 groups, and each group will pick one of the problems we identified earlier, and go through the problem-solving processes to reach a possible solution, while applying 1 or more of today’s learning outcomes. Afterwards each group will present their solution for 3 minutes, and take feedback for 2 minutes.

### Reflections

I leave you with these questions:
* How best should you apply these processes to the features you are working on in your current sprint?
* How can we become better at problem solving?
