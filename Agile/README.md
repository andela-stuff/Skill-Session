    * Waterfall is done in phases while Agile is done in sprints. Waterfall goes from one phase to the next while in Agile, sprints iterate over the various phases.
        * Planning
        * Design
        * Implementation
        * Testing (User-Acceptance Testing, UAT)
        * Deployment
        * Maintenance
    * In waterfall, different stakeholders are involved in different phases while all stakeholders are involved in the sprints for agile.
